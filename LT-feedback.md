***Project 1: VimeoOTT Recs***  
There are a lot of different ways you can slice this one. We will get into recommendation engines a bit later in the course, but this is something you could definitely try your hand at. Lets see what data you can grab first, then we can work with it to see which project may be best. Recommendation engines require lots of videos, lots of users, and some big infrastructure to process in.


***Project 2: VimeoOTT Subscriberss***  
This one is fairly straight forward. You could grab many samples of people that did end up subscribing and ones that did not (so you have labeled data and could model the probability that a person chooses to subscribe). As long as you have enough data, this is an awesome idea, and lends itself to tons of modeling!

***Project 3: Student Graduation***  
Problems like this are, unsurprisingly, challenging to structure. Making causal, claims is very difficult. Usually you are fairly limited by the data you have access to, but depending on what it looks like, you could do some cool work with it!


*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
