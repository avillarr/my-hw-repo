**Overall**  
Great work! I don't have any direct comments on the assignment. You performed the analysis effectively, and interpreted the results well. What I recommend is that you take this analysis/model, and try your hand using sklearn! Maybe even try out some different types of models we have learned: KNN, Decision trees, random forest, boosted trees, naive bayes, or SVMs!
