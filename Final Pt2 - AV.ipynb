    "### 1. Project Scope\n",
    "VimeoOTT sellers have the option to offer an initial 7,14, or 30 day free trial to their subscribers. Once this free trials is complete, subscribers may convert to a paying subscription or cancel their subscription entirely. For this project, I'd like to create a machine learning model that predicts the probability that a user will convert at the end of their free trial. I think the most important factors in predicting this will be length of free trial, view time (how long a user spent watching content during their free trial), and platform in which they began their subscription.

This table also logs whether a user was in an intial free trial, the length of the free trial, and the platform (i.e., iOS, android, web) in which the user began their subscription."

    "One concern/quesion I have is whether subscribers across all sites will exhibit the same behavior when they convert or not. VimeoOTT hosts a range of different sellers (in terms of genre and content library) which may need to be taken into account in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern I have is not having access to support data. Presumably users who contact support more frequently are having problems with the product and are less likely to convert.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't forsee any potential costs associated with an inaccurate model, as any initatives taken as a result would not lower conversion rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, I think VimeoOTT sellers would benefit from an accurate model because: a) understanding which users are more likely to convert would help them develop targeted marketing campaigns and b) understanding which users are less likely to convert would allow them to tailor support and promotions to high-risk users (i.e., users most likely to churn)."
